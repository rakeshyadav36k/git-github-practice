/**
 * Given an array arr[] of distinct positive integers. Your task is to find the largest subset such that for every pair of elements (x, y) in the subset, either x divides y or y divides x.
Note : If multiple subsets of the same maximum length exist, return the one that is lexicographically greatest, after sorting the subset in ascending order.
