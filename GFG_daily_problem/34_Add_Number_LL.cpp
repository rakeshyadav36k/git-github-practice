/**
 * Given the head of two singly linked lists num1 and num2 representing two non-negative integers. The task is to return the head of the linked list representing the sum of these two numbers.

For example, num1 represented by the linked list : 1 -> 9 -> 0, similarly num2 represented by the linked list: 2 -> 5. Sum of these two numbers is represented by 2 -> 1 -> 5.

Note: There can be leading zeros in the input lists, but there should not be any leading zeros in the output list.
